# Objective

The following script uses the modified dataset that was used for the DataViz assignment. I created a number score for the GZmehm1 score where 1 is very bad and 5 is very good. I also added life expectancy and age bins to the data set. 

To ensure that the script runs, download the required files from Google drive and put them in the respective directories. 

```{r}
#read in data file that already has life expectancy added

data_with_LE <- read_csv("data/translated_data2.csv")


```

```{r}
head(data_with_LE)
```
```{r}
head(df_geda_num)
```

```{r}
#select only Life_Expectancy, Age_bin and GZmehm1NumScore from dataframe with life expectancy

df_LE <- data_with_LE %>% dplyr::select(c(Age_bin, Life_Expectancy, GZmehm1NumScore))

```


```{r}
df_LE_noNA <- tidyr::drop_na(df_LE)
```


```{r}
score_life <- lm(Life_Expectancy~GZmehm1NumScore , df_LE_noNA)
```

```{r}
plot(df_LE_noNA$Life_Expectancy, df_LE_noNA$GZmehm1NumScore)
```


```{r}
summary(score_life)
```


```{r}
describe(df_LE_noNA$GZmehm1NumScore)
```
